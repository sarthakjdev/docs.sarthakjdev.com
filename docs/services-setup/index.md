Creating a comprehensive documentation for setting up a home server with multiple services using Docker Swarm involves multiple steps and considerations. Below is an outline of how the documentation could be structured across different Markdown (`.md`) files to ensure clarity and ease of navigation for the user.

Each `.md` file would contain the relevant detailed information for each section. The documents should be written in a clear, instructive manner, and code snippets should be provided where necessary to facilitate easy copying and pasting of commands. The documentation should also be versioned so that it can be updated over time as the setup evolves or new services are added.
