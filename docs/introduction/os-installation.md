## Choosing the Right Ubuntu Distribution

For the purposes of setting up a home server, we opted for the Ubuntu Server LTS edition. LTS stands for Long Term Support, ensuring that this version will receive updates for a more extended period.

## Creating a Bootable USB with Ubuntu Server

We used Rufus, a free, open-source tool, to burn the Ubuntu Server ISO onto a USB drive. This turned the USB drive into a bootable medium from which we could install Ubuntu Server.

## Installation of Ubuntu Server

The installation process for Ubuntu Server is straightforward:

1. Insert the bootable USB drive into the laptop.
2. Boot the laptop from the USB drive.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to install Ubuntu Server.
