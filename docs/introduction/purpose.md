# Purpose and Scope

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this documentation is to serve as a practical guide for setting up and managing a home server. As a software engineer with a keen interest in self-hosting solutions, I've curated a set of instructions, best practices, and personal insights to assist individuals—ranging from fellow developers to enthusiastic hobbyists—in creating a robust home server environment.

The server setup we will explore is designed to be versatile, allowing for various applications including but not limited to file storage, remote access via VPN, containerized applications, and monitoring services. The ultimate goal is to equip readers with the knowledge to build a server that is secure, efficient, and scalable to their personal or professional needs.

## Scope

This documentation encompasses a wide array of topics related to home server setup:

- **Hardware and Software Requirements:** A detailed overview of the necessary hardware components and software prerequisites to get your server up and running.

- **Server Configuration:** Step-by-step procedures for initial server setup, including operating system installation and network configuration.

- **Core Services:** Guidelines on deploying key services such as file sharing capabilities, VPN access, and container management using Docker and Docker Swarm.

- **Service Deployment and Management:** Instructions for deploying services using Docker compose, managing service lifecycle, and ensuring high availability.

- **Networking:** Configuration of internal and external networking, including reverse proxy setup with Nginx, and implementing security measures like firewalls and port forwarding.

- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implementation of monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track server performance and health, and strategies for log management.

- **Security Practices:** Strategies for server hardening, secure handling of secrets and credentials, and recommendations for regular security audits to protect sensitive data.

- **Maintenance and Troubleshooting:** Maintenance routines to keep the server updated and secure, along with a comprehensive troubleshooting section for diagnosing and resolving common issues.

- **FAQs and References:** A section dedicated to frequently asked questions for quick reference and a compilation of external resources for further reading and exploration.

- **Contributing to the Documentation:** An invitation to the community to contribute their knowledge and experience to improve and expand upon the documentation.

This documentation is not static; it is intended to evolve with advancements in technology, community contributions, and the continuous learning from the deployment and management of home servers. It aims to be as accessible as possible, demystifying complex concepts without sacrificing the depth of information.

By the end of this documentation, you should be able to confidently build and maintain a home server that caters to your specific requirements, whether for development, testing, or personal use.
