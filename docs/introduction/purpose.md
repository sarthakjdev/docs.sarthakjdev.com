# Purpose of Setting Up a Home Server

## Introduction

The journey of setting up a home server began with a blend of curiosity, a desire for personal growth in the field of DevOps, and a need for a centralized, efficient home network solution. This documentation serves as a roadmap outlining the rationale and objectives behind building and managing my home server.

## Motivation

1. **Self-Hosted Solutions:** Move away from reliance on third-party cloud services, enhancing privacy and control over my data.
2. **Learning and Skill Development:** Hands-on experience with server management, networking, and security â€“ crucial skills in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
3. **Centralized Media and File Storage:** Create a personal cloud for securely storing and accessing media and files from anywhere.
4. **Home Automation Hub:** Integrate and manage IoT devices and home automation services seamlessly.
5. **Personal Development Environment:** Host development tools and environments, enabling easy access to projects and coding platforms.

## Objectives

- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Leverage existing hardware efficiently, reducing the need for multiple devices and services.
- **Reliable Network Services:** Set up stable and secure services like file sharing (Nextcloud), media streaming (Jellyfin), and more.
- **Security and Privacy:** Implement robust security measures including firewalls, SSL/TLS, and secure VPN access.
- **Remote Accessibility:** Ensure secure and easy access to home server services from outside the home network.
- **Automation and Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD):** Automate routine tasks, server provisioning, and service deployment for efficiency and consistency.
- **Local DNS Management:** Manage local network traffic and service discovery via a self-hosted DNS server.
- **Learning and Documentation:** Document the setup process, challenges, and solutions as a valuable resource for the community and personal reference.

## Initial Strategy and Overview

- **Docker and Docker Swarm:** Utilize containerization to manage and isolate services, ensuring scalability and ease of deployment.
- **Nginx as Reverse Proxy:** Route and manage incoming traffic to various services securely.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel:** Securely expose services to the internet without opening local network ports.
- **Local DNS via Dnsmasq:** Resolve local domain names efficiently within the home network.
- **Ansible for Configuration Management:** Streamline and codify server and service configurations.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement solutions to monitor server health and log activities for proactive maintenance.

## Conclusion

The home server setup is more than just a technical project; it's an ongoing journey of learning, experimentation, and adaptation. It embodies my commitment to enhancing my technical skills, contributing to the self-hosting community, and achieving a more private, controlled, and efficient digital life.
