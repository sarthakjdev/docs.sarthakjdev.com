## Deployment Automation

### Overview

Deployment automation is seamlessly integrated within our CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent and reliable software deployment.

### GitHub Actions and Ansible for Automated Deployment

#### Process:

1. **Trigger**: Automatically starts upon successful code merges into the master branch.

2. **Ansible Playbooks**: Executes playbooks for server configuration and service deployment, including:

   - Docker network creation.
   - DNS, file server, media server, and logging stack deployment.
   - Nginx reverse proxy and Cloudflare tunnel setup.

3. **Feedback and Monitoring**: Post-deployment, I will be notified of the status, and the server's health is continuously monitored.

### Conclusion

Our home server's CI/CD pipeline, integrating GitHub Actions and Ansible, provides a comprehensive approach for continuous integration, configuration management, and deployment automation. This setup ensures our server is always up-to-date, secure, and performing optimally.
